# What is CUDA ?

CUDA is a platform and programming model for CUDA-enabled GPUs. The platform exposes GPUs for general purpose computing. CUDA provides C/C++ language extension and APIs for programming and managing GPUs.

In CUDA programming, both CPUs and GPUs are used for computing. Typically, we refer to CPU and GPU system as host and device, respectively. CPUs and GPUs are separated platforms with their own memory space. Typically, we run serial workload on CPU and offload parallel computation to GPUs.
